## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to streamline the process of managing a GPIB-controlled power supply, making it more accessible and efficient for users. The visual feedback ensures that users can monitor the system's status at a glance, reducing the likelihood of errors and improving overall usability.

## Usage
1. Connect the GPIB-controlled power supply to the system.
2. Launch the application.
3. Use the interface to adjust the power supply settings as needed.
4. Monitor the visual feedback to ensure proper operation.

## Future Improvements
- Support for additional GPIB devices.
- Enhanced customization options for the visual feedback system.
- Integration with logging and reporting tools for advanced monitoring.
